# Tracky

Using the huge database of book from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) , track down every book that you want to read, so when you get to it, you will now the title of that book you heard about months ago.

Then when you are ready to start a book, swipe it to your reading list.  This way you can see all the books you've started, and never got around to finishing. Don't start another one until you've finished your last. And when that is done, swipe it to the 'Finished Reading` list, then be proud of all the books you've read.
